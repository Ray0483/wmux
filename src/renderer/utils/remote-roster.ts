/**
 * The roster the remote console is allowed to see (#254).
 *
 * `window.__wmux_remoteRoster()` hands main the sidebar's own agent rollup, so
 * the phone inherits every rule already settled there (#235, #253) instead of
 * re-deriving agent state a second way. But the roster entry carries more than
 * a phone should: `metadata` (model, token counts), `detectedState`, `paneId`,
 * `identitySource`, and each declared choice's `key`/`text` — the exact bytes
 * `answer_agent` would type into the PTY. Those payloads stay in main
 * (`deliverAnswer` looks them up by id); the wire only ever needs an id to send
 * back and a label to show.
 *
 * So this is an explicit field-by-field COPY, never a spread or a delete: a
 * field added to AgentRosterEntry later does not reach the network until
 * someone adds it here on purpose. Main validates the result again anyway —
 * it arrives through `executeJavaScript` and is trusted no further than that.
