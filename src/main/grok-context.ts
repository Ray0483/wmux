/**
 * Grok Build (xAI's `grok` CLI) integration.
 *
 * Grok needs less from wmux than any agent before it, because it already reads
 * Claude Code's files: with its Claude compatibility on (every `[compat.claude]`
 * cell defaults to true) it loads ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and runs the hooks in
 * ~/.claude/settings.json. So a machine with the Claude integration granted was
 * already teaching Grok about wmux. This module covers the two places that
 * falls short.
 *
 * ── Hooks: $GROK_HOME/hooks/wmux.json ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same entries `applyWmuxHooks` writes for Claude Code, byte for byte, plus
 * the two turn endings only Grok has. `StopCancelled` runs INSTEAD of `Stop`
 * when a turn ends without completing (Ctrl+C, a declined permission, the turn
 * limit) and `StopFailure` instead of it on an API error; without them an
 * interrupted Grok turn left the pane reading `working` until the trust window
 * aged it out. wmux-hook.js reports both as the turn ending.
 *
 * Duplicating the Claude entries is safe because Grok dedupes handlers across
 * sources on (event, command, url, matcher) — so with compat on each hook runs
 * once, and with `compat.claude.hooks = false` this file alone still carries
 * the full set. That only holds while the bytes match, which is why the command
 * strings come from claude-context.ts rather than being spelled again here.
 *
 * ── Instructions: $GROK_HOME/rules/wmux.md, only when Grok would miss them ───
 *
 * Grok loads every `*.md` in its home rules dir, so like Kiro this is a file of
 * wmux's own. But it is written only when Grok will NOT already read the wmux
 * block out of ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — otherwise every Grok session would load the
 * same ~5 KB of instructions twice.
 *
 * Nothing is written unless Grok's home directory exists: creating ~/.grok on a
 * machine that has never run Grok would be the #132 mistake.
