// ─── Typing startup commands only once the shell is reading (issue #251) ─────
//
// A pane's `startupCommands` (quick-launch profiles #32, `wmux agent spawn`,
// `claude --resume <id>` on restore #186, a devcontainer re-entry #19) reach
// the shell one of two ways:
//
//   * PowerShell with the integration script: baked into WMUX_STARTUP_COMMANDS
//     and run by the script during init. No keystrokes at all — measured for
//     #251 by spawning pwsh 7 under node-pty exactly as PtyManager does, with a
//     stand-in `claude` that prints its argv: `["--resume","<id>"]` intact on
//     every run, via the npm `claude.ps1` shim and via a function wrapper.
//
//   * everything else (cmd, bash, WSL, PowerShell with no integration): TYPED
//     into the PTY. That used to happen in two places with two different rules.
//     The renderer wrote `<cmd>\r` on a blind 600 ms timer after pty.create —
//     which is the restore path #251 is about, and "pty created" is not "shell
//     reading": the reporter measured cmd at 372 ms and pwsh at 1.5 s to ready,
//     and switching to cmd made the loss rarer without closing it, which is the
//     signature of exactly that timer. agent-manager.ts had its own prompt
//     sniff for `wmux agent spawn`. Two deliveries with two ideas of "ready"
//     is how one of them stays broken while the other gets fixed.
//
// So PtyManager owns delivery now, for every caller, and this module is the
// rule it applies. Readiness, strongest signal first:
//
//   1. an OSC 133 prompt mark (A = prompt start, B = input start). The cmd
//      integration emits both from PROMPT, the bash integration from PS1: the
//      shell has drawn its prompt and is about to read. Deterministic.
//   2. a prompt-shaped last line (`PS C:\>`, `$ `, `# `, `C:\>`), for a shell
//      with no integration. A heuristic, so it only ever SHORTENS the wait.
//   3. output that has gone quiet for `quietMs` — the shell printed a banner
//      and stopped, which is what waiting at a prompt looks like from outside.
//   4. `maxWaitMs` after spawn, so a shell that prints nothing recognisable
//      still gets its command rather than silently dropping it.
//
// The decision is pure (`startupGateStep`) so every branch is testable without
// a PTY; `deliverStartupCommandsWhenReady` is the thin impure driver.

const ESC = String.fromCharCode(0x1b);
const BEL = String.fromCharCode(0x07);

// OSC 133;A or ;B, BEL- or ST-terminated, with or without trailing params
// (`133;A;cl=m` is legal FinalTerm). C/D are deliberately not readiness: they
// bracket a command's OUTPUT, which is the opposite of the shell reading.
const PROMPT_MARK_RE = new RegExp(String.raw`${ESC}\]133;[AB](?:;[^${BEL}${ESC}]*)?(?:${BEL}|${ESC}\\)`);

const OSC_SEQ = String.raw`${ESC}\][^${BEL}${ESC}]*(?:${BEL}|${ESC}\\)`;
const CSI_SEQ = String.raw`${ESC}\[[0-9;?]*[A-Za-z]`;
// Moved here from agent-manager.ts unchanged (#251).
//
// Does this chunk of shell output end on a prompt? Two things are easy to get
// wrong here, and each one silently costs every spawn the 1500 ms debounce:
//
//  - The prompt CHARACTER is not the last thing on the line any more. Since
//    #207 the shell integrations wrap the prompt in OSC 133 marks, so a
//    PowerShell prompt arrives as `PS C:\x> ` FOLLOWED BY `ESC ] 133;B ESC \`,
//    and PSReadLine / oh-my-posh tack CSI sequences (cursor show, SGR reset)
//    on after that. So after the prompt character this allows any run of
//    whitespace, OSC strings (BEL- or ST-terminated) and CSI sequences before
//    end-of-line — and nothing else, or a `>` in the middle of a banner would
//    count.
//  - `/m` is load-bearing: a chunk can carry several lines, and the prompt is
//    the last one.
//
// ESC and BEL are spelled out via fromCharCode rather than as `\x1b`/`\x07`
// in the literal: they are the terminator bytes of the very sequences this
// matches, and a raw control character in a regex literal is what the
// no-control-regex lint (rightly, elsewhere) rejects.
