/**
 * Which (pane, workspace) pair an `agent.spawn` actually means (issue #242).
 *
 * The bug was that the two were resolved INDEPENDENTLY. `workspaceId` came from
 * the active workspace and `paneId` was taken verbatim, so nothing ever checked
 * that the pane belonged to the workspace it was being filed under. Pass a pane
 * from a non-active workspace and the agent starts, runs, and is recorded
 * against the wrong workspace — after which every lookup that goes through the
 * workspace record fails, including `read-screen`, whose error then names three
 * causes that are all wrong ("markdown/browser pane, another window, or
 * closed"). The reporter restarted three orchestration waves chasing it.
 *
 * The fix is to make the pane AUTHORITATIVE whenever it is given. A pane
 * belongs to exactly one workspace and the split tree says which, so there is
 * nothing to infer: `--pane` alone reads as fully specified because it IS fully
 * specified.
 *
 * There is a second, mirrored half the report only suspected. Pane loads were
 * always read off the ACTIVE workspace, so `spawn_batch --workspace <other>`
 * honoured the flag for the record and ignored it for the panes — agents landed
 * in the active workspace's panes and were filed under the other one. Both
 * directions are the same mistake, so both are resolved here, once.
 *
 * Pure, with the renderer lookups injected. The split tree lives in the Zustand
 * store and main has no copy, so every question here is a round trip into a
 * renderer — which is exactly what makes the decision worth separating from the
 * asking. This is the shape `close-guard.ts` and `agent-browser-verbs.ts` use
 * for the same reason: a rule you can test without an Electron app.

 *
 * Order: the named workspace, then the CALLER's workspace, then the active one.
 * The caller step is #246. Every CLI call carries `caller: $WMUX_SURFACE_ID`,

 * (#143, `resolveCallerTarget` in v2-bridge.ts) — but this path never read it,

 * the user happened to have focused, and a hand-rolled spawn loop scattered its
 * agents across every workspace the user clicked while it ran. "The workspace I
 * am typing in" is what a bare `wmux agent spawn` means; the focused one is only
 * the right answer when there is no caller to ask about.
 *
 * A caller that does not resolve (stale id, a shell wmux did not start) falls
 * through to the active workspace SILENTLY — the rule resolveCallerTarget

/**
 * The full `agent.spawn` decision.

 *  - the pane is unknown to every window → -32602. Today this "succeeds": the
 *    agent spawns and the `AGENT_UPDATE` broadcast addresses a pane that does
 *    not exist, so nothing renders it and the caller is told everything is
 *    fine. A stale pane id is a caller bug, and saying so beats running an
 *    agent nobody can see.
 *  - the pane is known and no workspace was named → the OWNER is the answer,
 *    never the active workspace.
 *  - both named and they disagree → -32602 rather than a silently mismatched
 *    record. There is no reading of the request under which the caller wants
 *    the pane filed somewhere that does not contain it, and guessing which of
 *    the two they meant is how the original bug stayed invisible.
 *
 * With a pane named, neither the caller (#246) nor the ACTIVE workspace is
 * consulted at all — so a
 * fully-specified spawn now works when there is no active workspace, where it
 * used to fail -32000 for a reason that had nothing to do with the request.
