/**
 * V2 pipe surface for declared agent state (issue #128).
 *
 * Lives in its own module rather than the main V2 switch in index.ts: that
 * switch is already at the repo's cognitive-complexity and switch-case
 * ceilings, and routeSpecialV2 exists precisely so method families can be
 * routed off to their own dispatcher.
 *
 * Method names follow the issue's proposal (`pane.report_agent`, …). wmux keys
 * on surfaces rather than panes — a pane can hold several tabs and the agent
 * runs in exactly one of them — so `surfaceId` is the real parameter, with
 * `paneId` accepted as an alias for clients written against the original
 * wording.
